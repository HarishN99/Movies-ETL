# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create an automated pipline that has the ability to take in new data, perform appropriate transformations, and load data into existing tables in the SQL database. Specifically, the original code from Module 8 was refactored into one funciton that takes the Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. The deliverables for this prject includeded writing an ETL funciton to read three data files, extract and transform both the wikipedia and kaggle data, and fillany create the Movie Database in SQL.
